              <h1 class="heading-11">What Is The Pseudo Secure Initiative and Why Was It Built?</h1>
              <p class="left">While attending a 16-week full-stack web development course in Atlanta, Georgia, my car was broken into. I lost thousands of dollars of personal items and damages. Because of this event, I decided to research burglary statistics and began to realize how often burglaries occur in various regions. I then became inspired to build an affordable sensor that would notify a user with a text message when motion is detected. The goal was to lower the cost of installation fees associated with modern car alarms; aiming to create a temporary, inexpensive solution for those in need of an affordable alternative. Having a new baseline car alarm system installed cost me $350. This prototype design, however currently costs $25 wholesale to build and does not require a specialist to install. It can also be used inside a home or anywhere with access to a wifi connection. This is the process I went through to build this sensor and what I learned along the way. This project was built for educational purposes only and should not be used as a reliable form of security.<br></p>

              <h1 class="heading-11">Process Build, Challenges, and Site Walkthrough</h1>
              <p class="left">Without a background in C++ or Arduino, my first day was spent learning the anatomy of the Arduino and basic C++ syntax. Before building anything I decided to learn how to do basic tasks such as make an LED blink, understand power source requirements, limitations of digital vs. analog I/O pins, and basic terminology. Luckily, I had spent the last two and half years working as an industrial electrician wiring I/O circuits on programming logic controllers (PLC&#x27;s) and various other uncommon electrical devices. Never having programmed a logic controller or designed an electrical circuit from scratch, I was intimidated starting out. However, I soon came to appreciate the challenges that were ahead of me.<br></p>
              <h1 class="heading-11">Giving Power to the Super Sonic Sensor, LED, and Horns</h1>
              <p class="left">Once I was able to identify all the parts needed to build this project, I began with powering the Ultra Sonic Sensor. I provided 5v power from the Arduino to the sensor along with a ground. The sensor also required two signal wires, an input, and an output. There are two parts to this sensor; a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter emits a high pitched frequency inaudible to most humans and is responsible for sending the frequency that rebounds and travels back to the receiver. Based on the amount of time that elapses, we can calculate the approximate distance of the obstruction. We can use this change in state to determine that there has been an intruder or airwave interference. The sensor has a detection range of up to 13 feet.I also wanted to be able to trigger a horn and light as output signals from the Arduino but only once something is detected. <br><br>I added a 220k Ohm resistor in series with the LED to lower the current coming in so not to destroy the LED as this LED only needed .20amps of voltage to be powered. The horn, however, needed 5v which I was able to get from the Arduino. The reason we want the LED and the HORN to be outputs rather than plug them directly to 5v is the light and horn would always be on as opposed to when the Arduino fires it on when a certain condition is met. Simple C++ conditionals gave me the ability to write logical statements that could be parsed.<br><br></p>
              <h1 class="heading-11">Powering the 8266 Wifi chip, downloading the drivers and libraries</h1>
              <p class="left">This process took a lot of time to work through because different wifi-chips require different drivers and download instructions. Adding more complexity, there were many variations to this type of wifi chip. The chip needed 3.3 volts to be powered, as well as a ground. The Arduino also had a pin that output 3.3v, but after hours of research, I discovered this pin could potentially be an unstable or unreliable power source. This led me to build a voltage regulator with an input of 5v from the Arduino and an output of 3.3v. To achieve this I ran a 1uf capacitor and .01cf capacitor in series. This did work but after powering the wifi chip from the 3.3v directly and never experienced any powering issues, I removed the voltage regulator from the circuit. Next, I needed the appropriate drivers, and libraries to get the chip in working order. After reading the documentation for several hours and experimenting, I was able to upload a simple blink program. Once I knew I could do this, I knew I could upload a more complex program.<br></p>
              <h1 class="heading-11">Voltage Dividing and powering the 8266 wifi-chip ADC pin</h1>
              <p class="left">The biggest challenge was figuring out how to fire an output signal to a pin on the wifi chip and read the digital value of the pin. The logic I proposed was as follows...<br>‚Äç<br>If the value returned was LOW, do nothing because there is no voltage applied and if the returned value was HIGH, trigger the RESTful API route that will allow us to be notified of an intruder. This, however, did not work. After another day of digging, I received a tip from my teacher to consider reading analog values rather than digital. Because of this tip, I decided to take a deeper look in this direction. I realized the specific wifi chip I had could not read digital values on their GPIO pins. The built-in internal pull-down and pull-up resistor prevent you from being able to change and read states on the fly. <br><br>As there were almost 20 variations of the 8266 wifi chip each with certain capabilities and restrictions, it made things extremely tricky in deciding what to implement. Powered incorrectly, would potentially destroy the wifi chip. I finally narrowed it down to the ADC pin which could read analog values. The only catch was it was 1v compatible unlike the rest of the chip that was 3.3 volt compatible. So if there was voltage applied, the value read would be between 0 and 1024. If all goes well when voltage closer to a full 1v is applied your ADC pin should read 1024 and anything less than 1v should continuously be less than 1024. For example, if you have applied .5v then your analog value could read as 500. It won&#x27;t be exact each time but perfect for what I needed to do.<br></p>
              <h1 class="heading-11">Glimpse into the Arduino 8266 Wifi Chip C++ Code</h1>
              <p class="left">Here we have a few library imports that allow the wifi chip to access a wifi connection. We enter the name of the wifi network along with the password. Once the wifi connection is made we set up a post request to localhost 3000 including our IP Address. On the other end, I have Express listening for requests on localhost 3000. If the connection was successful, we will get a message in JSON letting us know we are connected to the wifi network. From there we compare our analog read value to its prior state. If no one has crossed in front of the sensor then the analog read value will be very low(less than 850). However, once someone has crossed in front of the sensor the voltage on the ADC pin will be 1v(an output from pin 8 on the Arduino) changing the analog read value to 1024. We evaluate this condition in a loop so that we know when the analog value becomes 1v. This value will be above 850 and will trigger a different post request that express is listening for, letting us know that the alarm has been triggered.<br></p>
              <h1 class="heading-11">Future Goals and Added Features</h1>
              <p class="left">1. Incorporate a range extender for those whose wifi connection doesn&#x27;t have a great reach after a certain distance<br>2. Eliminate the need for a wifi-connection altogether and create an alternative to long distance security options where wifi isn&#x27;t available, such as a public parking lot or with street parking outside a wifi range.<br>3. Update and expand on the back end functionality and make the user experience more fluid, pertaining to registering a product and product support.<br>4. Add additional sensors to widen the range of the sensor to be 45 degrees with 3 sensors as opposed to only 1 with a 15-degree view.<br>5. Convert front end to React and creat marketing/landing page<br></p>
